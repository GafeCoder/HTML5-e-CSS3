        <p>Non-conforming features
            Elements in the following list are entirely obsolete, and must not be used by authors:
            
            applet
            Use embed or object instead.
            
            acronym
            Use abbr instead.
            
            bgsound
            Use audio instead.
            
            dir
            Use ul instead.
            
            frame
            frameset
            noframes
            Either use iframe and CSS instead, or use server-side includes to generate complete pages with the various invariant parts merged in.
            
            isindex
            Use an explicit form and text control combination instead.
            
            keygen
            For enterprise device management use cases, use native on-device management capabilities.
            
            For certificate enrollment use cases, use the Web Cryptography API to generate a keypair for the certificate, and then export the certificate and key to allow the user to install them manually. [WEBCRYPTO]
            
            listing
            Use pre and code instead.
            
            menuitem
            To implement a custom context menu, use script to handle the contextmenu event.
            
            nextid
            Use GUIDs instead.
            
            noembed
            Use object instead of embed when fallback is necessary.
            
            param
            Use the data attribute of the object element to set the URL of the external resource.
            
            plaintext
            Use the "text/plain" MIME type instead.
            
            rb
            rtc
            Providing the ruby base directly inside the ruby element or using nested ruby elements is sufficient.
            
            strike
            Use del instead if the element is marking an edit, otherwise use s instead.
            
            xmp
            Use pre and code instead, and escape "<" and "&" characters as "&lt;" and "&amp;" respectively.
            
            basefont
            big
            blink
            center
            font
            marquee
            multicol
            nobr
            spacer
            tt
            Use appropriate elements or CSS instead.
            
            Where the tt element would have been used for marking up keyboard input, consider the kbd element; for variables, consider the var element; for computer code, consider the code element; and for computer output, consider the samp element.
            
            Similarly, if the big element is being used to denote a heading, consider using the h1 element; if it is being used for marking up important passages, consider the strong element; and if it is being used for highlighting text for reference purposes, consider the mark element.
